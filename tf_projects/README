Things need to solve: For Tensorflow Estimator
    1. how tuning tensorflow hyperparameter?
    2. How to predict by checkpoints?
        set specific chenpoint file to checkpoints parameter
        e.g.train_pred_results = model.predict(input_fn=train_pred_input_fn,checkpoint_path='./model.ckpt-18400')
    3. How to show loss curve for both training and developing set at the same time?
